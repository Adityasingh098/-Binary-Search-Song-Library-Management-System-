# Project Document

## Tech Stack

### Technologies and Tools Used

- **HTML**: Structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the web page.
- **JavaScript**: Logic and functionality for the binary tree.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Concepts and implementation for creating and manipulating binary search trees (BST).

## Project Details

### Overview

The Song Library Management System is a web app enabling users to manage songs with features for adding, searching by title (using binary search), and deleting songs. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development, emphasizing efficient data operations through binary search algorithms for maintaining sorted song lists.

### Features


1. Add new songs with details like title, artist, album, genre, and duration.
2. Search for songs by title using efficient binary search.
3. Delete songs by title while maintaining sorted order using binary search.
4. Responsive web interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
5. Facilitates efficient management and organization of a song collection.


### Functionalities


1.Search Song: Utilizes binary search to efficiently locate songs by their title. This ensures quick retrieval of song details based on user queries.

2.Insert Song: Incorporates binary search to maintain the sorted order of songs in the library when adding new songs. This optimizes the insertion process and keeps the song list organized alphabetically by title.

3.Delete Song: Uses binary search to find and remove songs from the library while preserving the sorted order. This method ensures that deleting a song does not disrupt the alphabetical arrangement of remaining songs.

4.Maintain Sorted Order: Implements binary search to ensure that the list of songs remains sorted alphabetically by title at all times. This guarantees efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations without needing to resort the entire list.

### Project Structure


-**index.html**: Main HTML file containing the structure of the web application.
-**style.css**: CSS file for styling the HTML elements and layout of the application.
-**script.js**: JavaScript file containing the logic for dynamic behavior and functionalities of the application.
-**Images**: Folder containing any images used in the application, such as icons or album covers.

### Additional Project Ideas

The Song Library Management System is a web application designed to manage a collection of songs. It allows users to add new songs, search for songs by title, and delete existing songs. The system utilizes binary search to efficiently maintain and retrieve songs sorted by title.
This project serves as an educational tool to help users understand the concepts of Binary Search  through interactive song library management system and informative content.
